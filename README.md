# Hi, my name is Dick Wolff üê∫.

I'm a (full stack) software engineer and IT architect üë®üèª‚Äçüíª currently working at [Info Support](https://infosupport.com). My passion is front-end development (the touchy-feely stuff), but I also like to do backend development to shake things up. 

Since 2015 I've grown fond of motor racing. I started watching [Formula 1](https://formula1.com), and have since diversified my motor racing interest into other categories (like the F1 Feeder series, [F2](https://www.fiaformula2.com)), [IndyCar](https://indycar.com) and [WEC](https://fiawec.com).

In 2018 I discovered I liked traveling ‚úàÔ∏è and hiking ü•æ, like a lot! Since then I've been planning trips all around the world üåé.
