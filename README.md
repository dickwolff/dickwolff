### Hi, my name is Dick Wolff 🐺.

I'm a (full stack) software engineer 👨🏻‍💻 currently working at [Info Support](https://infosupport.com). My passion is front-end development (the touchy-feely stuff), but I also like to do backend development to shake things up. 

Since 2015 I've grown fond of motor racing. I started watching [Formula 1](https://formula1.com) a lot, and have since diversified my motor racing interest into other categories (like the F1 Feeder series ([F2](https://www.fiaformula2.com) and [F3](https://www.fiaformula3.com)), [IndyCar](https://indycar.com), [WEC](https://fiawec.com) and [Formula E](https://www.fiaformulae.com)).

In 2018 I discovered I liked traveling ✈️ and hiking 🥾, like a lot! Since then I've been planning a lot of trips all around the world 🌎. Check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dickw0lff) or [Polarsteps]() for my adventures.
